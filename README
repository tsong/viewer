     Overview
===================

This program loads 3D models in OBJ format and provides a simple arc-ball
camera to view it. Lights can be added, and different rendering
modes are available. Additionally, the mesh can be subdivided using the
Catmull-Clark subdivision algorithm.

Only quad meshes are currently supported.

===================
      Usage
===================

- To open an OBJ file, use the "File->Open OBJ" menu command

- Hold and drag the left mouse button to move the camera
- Hold and drag the right mouse button or use the scroll wheel to zoom
- Additional camera settings can be configured through the "Edit->Camera"
  menu option
- The camera's coordinate can be shown through the "Show->Info" 
  menu option

- Lights can be configured through the "Edit->Light Sources" menu option

- The coordinate axis can be shown through the "Show->Axis" menu option

- Different rendering modes can be selected in the "Render" menu
	- Default OpenGL shading
	- Wireframe
	- Phong shading

- The "Subdivide" menu allows you to specify the number of steps to perform
  subdivision. NOTE: This may take a long time for larger meshes.

===================
     Build
===================

This program was built using Qt 4.7.0. After installing the framework, run
> qmake
